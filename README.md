# 🩺 Health Risk Analysis Dashboard using Python & Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing a health-related dataset to uncover insights about patient diagnoses, lifestyle habits, and risk factors. It uses **Python** for data preprocessing and detailed statistical analysis and **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## 📊 Report Objectives

The following insights are generated:

1. **📌 Total Diagnosed Patients**  
   Total number of patient records in the dataset.

2. **❤️ Heart Attack History (%)**  
   Percentage of patients with a heart attack history.

3. **🧠 Stroke History (%)**  
   Percentage of patients with a stroke history.

4. **🚺 Female Patients (Not Overweight)**  
   Count of female patients who are not overweight.

5. **📉 Health Risk Distribution**  
   Count of patients by Health Risk levels (Low, Moderate, High).

6. **⚖️ Average Weight by Occupation**  
   Avg. weight of patients grouped by occupation.

7. **🌎 Overweight Count by Race**  
   Total overweight patients based on racial group.

8. **📈 Normal Health by Age Group**  
   Number of patients with normal health in each age group.

9. **🚬 Smokers with High Risk**  
   Patients who smoke and are at High health risk.

10. **🏃 Low Exercise (<30 min) with Risk**  
    Patients who exercise less than 30 minutes and are at **High** or **Moderate** risk.
